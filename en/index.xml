      <description>How to set up a container deployment pipeline with AWS Fargate and GitHub actions There are many tutorials online and scattered documentation on how to do this, but not a single guide you can follow from start to finish, so here you have an attempt to do that.
Requirements For this to work, you will need a few things set up first, some of them won&amp;rsquo;t be covered entirely because we want to focus on the AWS Fargate deployment pipeline.</description>
